Question 3. What is the difference between splhigh and spl0? Explain.
splhigh sets the set priority level to the highest value and disable all interrupts while spl0 sets spl to 0 and enable all interrupts.

Question 4. What are some of the details which would make a function “machine dependent”?
Why might it be important to maintain this separation, instead of just putting all of the code in
one function?
The 
Question 5. What does splx return? How did you get your answer? Explain.
It returns the previous spl value before the splx function changed it. 
According to line 104-107 from os161-1.11/kern/arch/mips/include/spl.c, the function return the oldspl that is assigned with curspl.

Question 6. How many hardware interrupts lines does MIPS have? How many of them are we
actually using in OS/161?
Mips have 8(6 for hardware and 2 for software). 

Question 7. How many interrupt levels we actually use in OS/161?

Question 8. How large are OS/161 pids (process identifiers)? How many processes do you think
OS/161 could support as you have it now? A sentence or two for justification is fine.

Question 9. What is the system call number for a reboot? Is this value available to userspace
programs? Why or why not?
