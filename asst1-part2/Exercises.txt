1. Assume that the residents of Podunk are exceptional and follow the old (and widely ignored) convention that whoever arrives at the intersection first proceeds first. Using the language of synchronization primitives describe the way this intersection is controlled. In what ways is this method suboptimal?

Synchronization could be managed by a queue. Each vehicle would be time stamped on arrival and enqueued accordingly. The intersection would be controlled by locks on each segment (AB, BC, CA). The vehicle at the head of the queue would acquire the necessary lock(s) for its path, enter the intersection, and release the lock(s) when done. This method is suboptimal because it does not differentiate between vehicle types and could lead to inefficient traffic flow, especially under high traffic conditions or if a high-priority vehicle (like an ambulance) arrives just after another vehicle has entered the intersection.

2. Now, assume that the residents of Podunk are like most people and do not follow the convention described above. In what one instance can this three-way-stop intersection produce a deadlock? (It will be helpful to think of this in terms of the model we are using instead of trying to visualize an actual intersection)

In the absence of the first-come-first-serve convention, a deadlock would occur if each segment of the intersection (AB, BC, CA) is occupied by a vehicle that is waiting for the next segment to clear, which is also occupied by a vehicle waiting for another segment to clear, forming a circular wait. For instance, a vehicle in segment AB wanting to go to BC, another in BC wanting to go to CA, and a third in CA wanting to go to AB could all be waiting for each other indefinitely, thus causing a deadlock.
